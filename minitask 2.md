**CaptionCall Amplified Phone**

This works like a regular phone but uses voice-recognition technology to provide real-time written captions on a large-type touch screen. The phone is part of a free service 
funded by the federal government that’s similar to closed-captioning on TVs. Phone CaptionCall or go online for a form that needs to be certified 
by a medical professional that you have a hearing loss. Once you have the form, the company will send you a phone and arrange for installation — all for free.
