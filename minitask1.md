# EC07 Smart Spectacles for Auditorily impaired

**Problem statement**

Inorder to  grab the attention of deaf people immediately , we have to inevitably get in their field of view or touch them . Such is the daily scenario in the life of a deaf person, who is
unfortunately constrained only to procure critical data from their immediate field of view.

We propose to improve the situational awareness of auditorily impaired people by notifying the direction of the sound source in their environment. We propose to 
create a smart spectacles for the auditorily impaired , which signals the direction of sounds in their vicinity by signalling 
with LED lights on the spectacles .
